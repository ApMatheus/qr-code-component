## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fonts custon

### What I learned

* I reinforced some concepts that I already knew, such as the **root** variables, the **fonts** in **css***

```css
:root {
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --Grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --Dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: Outfit;
    src: url("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit");
}
```

### Continued development

* To further improve my knowledge, I will delve further into more complex projects that involve more technologies such as JS, React, Sass, etc.
